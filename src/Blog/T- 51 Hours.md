**Why I Volunteer**

"I started volunteering with the C.C.C.F. in 2015 after being asked by a friend.  Little did I know what a difference doing so would make.  Part of my responsibility was processing the applications for funding.  One time I met with a caregiver that was having difficulty processing the bills for his father, so I helped him figure out how we could help him.  At the end of our session I had the privilege of praying with him.  He left with a sense of relief.  

Being able to help alleviate some of the burden of the caregiver of a Cancer Patient is a rewarding feeling.  Volunteering for this organization has given me joy that stays for a lifetime." ~ _a C.C.C.F. Volunteer_
