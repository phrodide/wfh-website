# About Walk For Hope

"WALK FOR HOPE" was started by a committed group of people in 2010 for the purpose and intent of helping people with living expenses as they go through cancer treatment. All of these folks were either cancer survivors or had family members and loved ones who had gone through cancer treatment. Some of them were cancer survivors but many lost their battle to this devastating disease. Instead of focusing on their grief and loss, they chose to do something positive for the community. Since they all understood firsthand the financial difficulties and emotional stress, they decided that all of the funds that were raised would remain local.

Support has grown and “Walk for Hope” has become one of the biggest fundraising events in our community. In 2010, Walk for Hope had about 850 people in attendance and in 2022 there were approximately 7,000 people in attendance. It is well known as a family fun event and has gained the financial support from many local businesses and organizations throughout our area. There are many out of town participants who also come to enjoy Walk for Hope.

Every year a Walk for Hope Committee is formed and they work for many months to assure that the event is successful and safe!

Walk for Hope owes its success to the many volunteers, sponsors and participants who support it each year. Without all of you, there would not be “Walk for Hope”!

WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
