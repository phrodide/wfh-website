Dear Community Member and Walk for Hope Supporter: 

Chaves County Cancer Fund provides financial assistance to individuals diagnosed with cancer who reside in Chaves County. Walk for Hope is an event where our community can come together to raise money, honor cancer survivors, and help our community members who need assistance with practical needs during their cancer treatment. All of the Walk for Hope committee members and workers are unpaid volunteers, so all of the funds raised, minus expenses, go to Chaves County Cancer Fund. Many of you may have had cancer or have had family members or loved ones with cancer and know how difficult it is for the entire family. This disease is one that affects us all, so please join us on Saturday, October 14 from 6pm - 10pm at Gateway Christian School football field as we come together for a greater cause.

Walk for Hope is the major fundraiser for the Cancer Fund. Can you help us make Walk for Hope bigger and better, so we can help even more families through a difficult time as they go through cancer treatment? In 2022, Chaves County Cancer Fund gave over $85,000 in assistance, so you see how important it is we continue to raise funds for our community members with cancer.

There are many ways you can help. 

First, we need financial and in-kind sponsors to help us succeed.
There are several sponsorship levels to choose from and any/everything helps. 

Second, you can have a team at the actual event to show your support and raise money before and/or during Walk for Hope. 

Lastly, you can help us find local cancer survivors and encourage them to attend the event so we can honor them, their families, and caregivers. 

Individual registration fees will be $20 and includes a "Walk for Hope" t-shirt if submitted by the t-shirt deadline. After the deadline there isn't a guarantee on the t-shirt. The registration fee for cancer survivors is waived and t-shirts are provided at no cost if submitted by the t-shirt deadline.

If you are interested in joining us in any way mentioned above, please contact Carolyn Hardwick or Reyna Silva, Sponsor Coordinators or Team Captain Coordinator Mikaela Moreno at walkforhopeRoswell@ gmail.com or 575-420-4761 / 575-637-6464 / 575-420-5402.

We hope to see you on October 14th at WALK FOR HOPE.

Respectfully,

Debbie Lamb, Committee Co-Chair
Carolyn Hardwick, Committee Co-Chair
